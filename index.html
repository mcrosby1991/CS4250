<p><b>Relations:</b></p>
<!--In the following, substitute actual names for Relation1, Relation2
etc. Have as many entries as the number of relations in your project.
Clicking a link on a relation name should execute an SQL query and list
*all* the tuples in that particular relation (of course, the links below don't work).
Your output should be presented on a separate web page in a neat,
orderly fashion, one row for each tuple and columns plainly evident.
Ensure that all columns have their headers listed and their data types are
clear (i.e., state which is an int and which is a char and so on).-->

<p><b>Queries:</b></p>
<!--In the following, add an English
query description for each of the five queries that you created for Part 6 of
your project.  Again, clicking a link on the query name should execute
the appropriate SQL query and list the tuples that are the answer to
that particular query.  Again, make sure your output is neatly ordered
and column names and data types are evident. The output of the query
should appear on a separate page.  Near the top of the page, above the tidily
presented query output, <big><b>must be</b></big> the original SQL for your query.</i><p>
-->
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.csustan.edu/">Query1</a>:
Among library goers that are blocked, what is the average amount of money that they owe to the library?
<li><a href="http://www.cs.csustan.edu/">Query2</a>:
What is the genre of the ISBN “2591400744985,” what branches can I find it in and what sections within those branches will I actually be looking for a copy?
<li><a href="http://www.cs.csustan.edu/">Query3</a>:
In the entire library, including all branches, what genres have more than one section dedicated to them and how many sections does each have?
<li><a href="http://www.cs.csustan.edu/">Query4</a>:
What languages does the library carry for their periodicals?
<li><a href="http://www.cs.csustan.edu/">Query5</a>:
How many rented books are due back in December of 2016 before Christmas?
</ol>

<p><b>Ad-hoc Query:</b></p>
<!--Provide a free-form box and two buttons called
"Submit" and "Clear" here. The intent is that the user can enter most arbitrary
SQL queries in the box and click the submit button. The action should be that you should
execute that query on the database and bring up the answers on a separate
page, once again, in a neat, orderly fashion. Notice that the input
can be most legal SQL queries (permissible under your DB system, of course).
(SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE should definitely be allowed.)

The grader will use table names from your own documentation (Project Part 3, etc),
so <strong>do not change the names of your tables</strong> unless you update all of your
documentation to match the new names.  (Did you test your ad-hoc query form with a "like" query?) -->

<form METHOD=POST ACTION="library.php">
   <table>
     <tr>
       <td align = right>
          <strong>Please enter your query here<br></strong>
       </td>
       <td>
          <input type=text size=100 maxlength=140 name="query">
       </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td align = right>
          <input type=reset value="Clear">
       </td>
       <td>
          <input type=submit value="Submit">
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
